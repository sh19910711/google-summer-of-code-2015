## Project Description

The web-console is a debugging tool for Ruby on Rails web applications.
In order to debug web applications, it provides an interactive Ruby session to the developers.
The console will be displayed in the current page of the browser,
and the session in the console has the context of the code of the web application.
It allows to debug web application interactively.

The main goal of this project is to create the browser extensions of web-console.
For example, it allows to display the console aside from the web application's view (e.g, in the developer tools of the browsers)
By doing this, the console can be displayed without breaking affects to the view code (HTML) of the web application.

The project makes the web-console loose coupling from the Rails applications,
and it is important to debug applications without extra effects.

### Why did you choose this idea?

Basically, whatever, I am interested in the tools from debugging,
and I have some experiences of the browser extension projects,
so it fits with me and my skills.

### Please describe an outline project architecture or an approach to it

#### 1. Add "X-WEB-CONSOLE-DEVTOOLS" as a HTTP Response Header

The web-console is displayed by calling console() method from a view or controller.
For example, the developer will be needed to add a line such as "<% console %>" to the view in the case of using ERB.
I think the similar switch is needed for triggering browser extension (to open, reload, and etc?).

My idea is to add "X-WEB-CONSOLE-DEVTOOLS" to the HTTP response headers when browser extension is enabled.
In other words, if the browser extension is enabled, the web application always returns "X-WEB-CONSOLE-DEVTOOLS: true" as a HTTP headers.

The header can be enabled by writing `config.web_console.devtools = true` in the config file.
In order to inject that HTTP header, I will extend WebConsole::Middleware in the web-console repository. It should be a small change.

#### 2. Implement Context Viewer

It is a tool like css properties viewer of the Chrome DevTools,
and the user can view the list of all variables and its values.
The context view window can show to next to the console window in the browser extension.
I will implement it as the view of web-console (same as the console view).

#### 3. Add Support for Browsers

At first, I will create a chrome extension as prototype.
When the feature forms concrete shape,
then I will create Firefox Extension which has same behavior with the Chrome Extension.

### Give us details about the milestones for this project

Here is a timeline:

// 28 Apr. - 24 May

Milestone #0 - Community Bonding Period

* Check and brush up the feature and architecture of the software
* Find and fix issues of web-console
  - I will keep to do it in the whole terms

// 25 May - 25 Jun.

Milestone #1 - First-Term

* Support custom HTTP header on WebConsole::Middleware
* Show console
* Implement context viewer (as prototype)
* [Extra Task] Find cross-platform browser extension SDK or library


// 26 Jun. - 16 Aug.

Milestone #2 - Second-Term

* Finish to implement context viewer
* Support Firefox
* [Extra Task] Support Safari


### Why will your proposal benefit Ruby on Rails?

Not only display console, the browser-extension will have potentials to add
more useful supports of web-console.

### Why are you interested in Open Source?

It leads to well designed software.
Accumulated things by open source are not only source code of software but also approaches how to create software.
There are many things to learn from open source.
For example, I like testing software, and I have been learning many things about testing from open source.

### How long will the project take? When can you begin?

It will take a month to create prototype as Chrome Extension,
and also take a month to support other browsers.
I can start as soon as the end of May.

### How much time do you expect to dedicate to this project? (weekly)

I can dedicate 40 hours a week for the project.

### Where will you based during the summer?

Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan.

### What timezone will you be working in and what hours do you plan to work?

I'm at JST, which is UTC+09:00

### Do you have any commitments for the summer? (holidays/work/summer courses)

No.

## Other

### Have you ever participated in a previous GSoC? If yes, describe your project.

No.

### Have you applied for any other 2014 Summer of Code projects? If yes, which ones?

Yes, I applied to Git in the last year.

## Why did you apply for the Google Summer of Code ?

I'm new to open source, but I would like to work with open source,
since open source software helps my programming activities a lot.

## Why did you choose Ruby on Rails as a mentoring organisation?

I like web development by Ruby, and Ruby on Rails is one of the most popular web framework in the world,
so there is no reason not to try to contribute it in this summer.

## Why do you want to participate and why should Ruby on Rails choose you?

I want to participate GSoC because I have to earn money to live as a student.
After GSoC, I want to keep to contribute to the web console and Rails community.
